# Hello-World
It's my first project of such type. I want to create something special but I don't know what it will be yet. I love the idea of free sharing and possibility to learn something new.


Hi people :)

I'm Helena

I had never coding before, it's my first time. I'm interesting in programming for a long time but I never have a time to do this. I also like reading, meditation and spend time with my friends.
